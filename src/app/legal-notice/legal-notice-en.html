    <h2 id="m2427">Applicable Legal Bases</h2>
    <p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which 
        we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your 
        or our country of residence may also apply. If other specific legal bases apply in individual cases, we will 
        inform you of them in this privacy policy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is 
            necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or to take steps at the 
            request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary to safeguard the 
            legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that these interests do not override the 
            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, national regulations 
        on data protection in Germany apply. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). The 
        BDSG contains special regulations regarding the right of access, the right to deletion, the right to object, the 
        processing of special categories of personal data, the processing for other purposes, the transfer of data, as 
        well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. State-specific data protection laws may also 
        apply.</p>

    <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures, in accordance with legal requirements, to ensure an 
        adequate level of security, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, 
        scope, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of potential risks to the 
        rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
    <p>These measures include, in particular, safeguarding data confidentiality, integrity, and availability through 
        controls on access to physical and electronic data, data entry, transfer, and segregation. We have also 
        implemented procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data 
        breaches.</p>
    <p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted through 
        our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
        and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These 
        technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between 
        two servers), ensuring data is protected from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version 
        of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. If a website is secured by an 
        SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the presence of HTTPS in the URL, serving as a signal to users that 
        their data is transmitted securely and encrypted.</p>

    <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) 
        or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this processing occurs in the context of using third-party services, 
        disclosing or transmitting data to other persons or entities, this is done only in compliance with legal 
        requirements.</p>
    <p>        If the data protection level in the third country is recognized as adequate by a decision of the European Commission 
        (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers will only occur if the data 
        protection level is secured by other means, especially through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), 
        explicit consent, or if the transfer is required for contractual or legal reasons (Art. 49(1) GDPR). We will provide 
        further details regarding third-country transfers for individual providers based in third countries, where adequacy 
        decisions are given priority.</p>
    <p>More information on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found on the EU Commission's 
        information page: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de" target="_blank">
        https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de</a>.
        Under the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the European Commission also recognized the data protection 
        level of certain U.S. companies as adequate through its adequacy decision dated July 10, 2023. A list of certified 
        companies and further details about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website: <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" 
        target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal requirements once the consent on which the 
        processing is based is revoked or other legal grounds for the processing no longer exist. This includes cases 
        where the original purpose for processing ceases to apply or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions exist when 
        legal obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
    <p>Specifically, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons, or that must be stored to enforce rights 
        or protect the rights of others, will be archived as required.</p>
    <p>Our data protection notices contain additional information about retention and deletion of data, which may apply 
        to specific processing activities.</p>
    <p>If multiple retention or deletion periods are specified for a particular type of data, the longest period 
        generally applies.</p>
    <p>Retention periods that are not explicitly tied to a specific date and are at least one year long start 
        automatically at the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurs. In the case of ongoing 
        contractual relationships involving stored data, the triggering event is the effective date of termination or 
        other cessation of the legal relationship.</p>
    <p>Data that is no longer needed for its original purpose but must be retained for legal or other reasons will be 
        processed solely for the purposes that justify its retention.</p>

    <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
    <p>The rights of data subjects under the GDPR include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular 
            situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data, which is carried out based on Art. 6(1)(e) or 
            (f) GDPR, including profiling based on these provisions. If your personal data is processed for direct 
            marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such 
            marketing; this also applies to profiling to the extent it is related to such direct marketing.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw any consent you have given at any 
            time.</li>
        <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal 
            data concerning you is being processed, and, if so, to access the personal data and certain other information 
            as provided by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal 
            data or the correction of inaccurate personal data concerning you in accordance with legal requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing:</strong> You have the right to request that personal 
            data concerning you be deleted without undue delay, or alternatively, to request restriction of processing 
            of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, 
            which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to have the 
            right to transmit those data to another controller.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong> Without prejudice to any other 
            administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, 
            particularly in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged 
            infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.</li>
    </ul>
